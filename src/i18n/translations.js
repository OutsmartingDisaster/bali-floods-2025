        content1: "The year 2025 witnessed one of the most severe natural disasters ever to occur in Bali. It peaked on September 10, 2025, when high-intensity rain drenched almost all regions of Bali, causing six districts/cities to be completely paralyzed. Flash floods and landslides arrived simultaneously, claiming lives and devastating existing buildings.",
        content2: "Behind this tragedy lies a paradox: 'Bali, Indonesia's icon of tourism and international diplomacy' is often lauded as a global stage, repeatedly hosting high-level forums on climate resilience and disaster risk reduction. Ironically, when disaster strikes, that stage transforms into a test of how resilient the region is in saving its people.",
        content3: "This narrative is not just about presenting data and maps. It is an effort to uncover the chronology, impacts, and critical questions: Are infrastructure and policies truly resilient? Or are there still fundamental gaps in understanding and preparedness?",

        paragraph2: "Data was collected from public posts including videos, photos, stories, and reposts circulating during September 9–11, 2025. This process gathered 80 videos and 78 screenshots from 38 Instagram accounts. Sources include local information accounts like @infodenpasar, @denpasarhits_, and @seputarbali.viral; official government agency accounts like @satlantas_polrestadenpasar, @poldabali, and @polsekdenbar_; as well as individual citizen accounts. This diversity of sources strengthens data quality by presenting perspectives from community media, official agencies, and directly affected residents.",
        paragraph3: "Analysis techniques were conducted in several stages. First, location identification using visual cues such as street signs, distinctive buildings, and GPS-tagging. Second, flood height estimation by comparing scale with human bodies, vehicles, or other visual elements in posts. Third, chronology was constructed based on upload time, caption information, and user comments. These results were then cross-verified with online media reports and official data from BMKG and BNPB, making the information more credible despite being based on citizen participation.",
        paragraph4: "Crowdsourcing results identified 57 flood points in Denpasar and Badung, including several landslide incidents in Mengwi and Kapal areas. Flood heights varied from knee to waist-deep (0.5–1.2 meters), while in certain locations like Pasar Badung–Kumbasari and Jalan Sutomo, water reached over two meters, submerging houses up to the roof. These flood points show strong correlation with Tukad Badung waterways and its tributaries, as well as clogged urban drainage areas.",
        paragraph5: "From a chronological perspective, flooding began in the early hours of September 10, when areas like Jalan Resimuka, Mahendradata, and Monang-maning started to flood. By morning, Tukad Badung overflow caused major flooding at Pasar Badung, Pasar Kumbasari, and Kampung Jawa, with water heights exceeding two meters. By midday, flooding spread to vital access points like the Dewa Ruci Underpass which was completely paralyzed. Significant impact also occurred on Jalan Hasanuddin, where a shophouse collapsed claiming lives. By evening to night, some areas began to recede, though persistent flood points remained in areas like Nakula and Dewi Sri.",
        paragraph6: "The recorded impact through citizen data was substantial. At least 18 deaths, over 200 evacuees, and several vital infrastructure paralyzed. Traditional markets as economic centers, health services like RSUD Mangusada, and main transportation routes to Kuta–Sanur were disrupted. Additionally, structural damage including collapsed houses, riverbank erosion, and waste accumulation in Tukad Badung flow exacerbated the post-flood situation.",
        paragraph7: "These findings confirm that social media-based crowdsourcing methodology can provide rapid, detailed, and spatial overview of urban disasters. Despite limitations in quantitative measurement, participatory data from communities enriches official information by showing actual flood points, event chronology, and direct narratives of residents' experiences. Thus, crowdsourcing can become an important complement to disaster monitoring and documentation systems in the future, while emphasizing the need for improved early warning and community-based preparedness in Bali."

        content1: "The Denpasar flood in September 2025 serves as a painful reminder: public trust is a fragile asset easily eroded by neat justifications. As the waters receded, the first narrative presented to the public was singular—that the disaster was due to extreme weather. The System swiftly used scientific data about Rossby Waves or the MJO to wash its hands of structural responsibility.",
        content2: "In reality, this flood is the result of a complex calculation between uncontrollable rainfall and systemic failures that are within control. These failures manifested in: building permits continuously issued in water catchment areas, a city drainage system left clogged with years of trash, and spatial planning inconsistencies that sacrificed rivers for property interests. The System failed to manage fundamental issues, yet asks the people to accept the easiest excuse: that nature was raging.",
        content3: "The Denpasar Flood of 2025 is a stark reminder that resilience is not born from grand meetings or thick documents, but from tangible actions felt in daily life. Resilience will not be achieved if the government acts merely as an administrator who shifts the blame onto natural phenomena.",
        content4: "It is time for Bali to not only be a stage for global discussions but also to be truly resilient ground, where the spirit of resilience grows and strengthens up to the highest policies. Bali no longer needs to be a showcase for climate seminars that end with fragile local policies. True resilience is accountability.",
        reflection: "Resilience grows from the roots, from a community that protects one another, from traditions that respect nature, all the way up to policies that side with life. And, amidst the mud and slowly receding water, we need to pause and ask: have we truly learned from the disaster, or are we just spectators waiting for the next one to arrive? That question is not for the people cleaning their homes, but for the system tasked with guarding the promise of protection."

Puncaknya tanggal 10 September 2025, hujan dengan intensitas tinggi mengguyur hampir seluruh wilayah Bali dan menyebabkan enam kabupaten/kota lumpuh total. Banjir bandang dan longsor datang bersamaan, merenggut nyawa serta meluluhlantakkan bangunan yang ada.",
        content2: "Di balik tragedi ini, tersimpan paradoks: 'Bali, ikon pariwisata dan diplomasi internasional Indonesia' sering dielu-elukan sebagai panggung dunia, berulang kali menjadi tuan rumah forum tingkat tinggi tentang ketangguhan iklim dan pengurangan risiko bencana. Ironisnya, saat bencana terjadi, panggung itu berubah menjadi ujian seberapa tangguh daerah ini menyelamatkan rakyatnya.",

      researchMethodology: {
        title: "Metodologi Penelitian: Crowdsourcing Media Sosial",
        paragraph1: "Untuk memahami dinamika bencana ini, penelitian menggunakan metode crowdsourcing berbasis media sosial, khususnya Instagram, guna merekonstruksi kronologi kejadian, sebaran genangan, dan dampak banjir.",
        paragraph2: "Data dikumpulkan dari unggahan publik berupa video, foto, story, hingga repost yang beredar sepanjang periode 9–11 September 2025. Dari proses ini, berhasil dihimpun 80 video dan 78 tangkapan layar dari 38 akun Instagram. Sumber akun mencakup akun informasi lokal seperti @infodenpasar, @denpasarhits_, dan @seputarbali.viral; akun resmi instansi pemerintah seperti @satlantas_polrestadenpasar, @poldabali, dan @polsekdenbar_; serta akun individu masyarakat. Ragam sumber ini memperkuat kualitas data karena menyajikan perspektif dari media komunitas, instansi resmi, dan warga terdampak langsung.",
        paragraph3: "Teknik analisis dilakukan dengan beberapa tahap. Pertama, identifikasi lokasi menggunakan petunjuk visual seperti papan jalan, bangunan khas, dan GPS-tagging. Kedua, estimasi tinggi genangan dilakukan dengan membandingkan skala tubuh manusia, kendaraan, maupun elemen visual lain dalam unggahan. Ketiga, kronologi disusun berdasarkan waktu unggah, keterangan pada caption, serta komentar pengguna. Hasil ini kemudian diverifikasi silang dengan laporan media daring serta data resmi dari BMKG dan BNPB, sehingga informasi yang diperoleh lebih kredibel meskipun berbasis partisipasi warga.",
        paragraph4: "Hasil crowdsourcing mengidentifikasi 57 titik banjir di Denpasar dan Badung, termasuk beberapa kejadian gerakan tanah di kawasan Mengwi dan Kapal. Tinggi genangan bervariasi dari selutut hingga sepinggang orang dewasa (0,5–1,2 meter), sementara pada lokasi tertentu seperti Pasar Badung–Kumbasari dan Jalan Sutomo, air mencapai lebih dari dua meter hingga merendam rumah sampai atap. Titik-titik banjir ini menunjukkan keterkaitan erat dengan alur Tukad Badung dan anak sungainya, serta area drainase perkotaan yang tersumbat.",
        paragraph5: "Dari sisi kronologi, banjir mulai muncul pada dini hari 10 September, ketika kawasan Jalan Resimuka, Mahendradata, dan Monang-maning mulai tergenang. Menjelang pagi, luapan Tukad Badung menyebabkan banjir besar di Pasar Badung, Pasar Kumbasari, dan Kampung Jawa, dengan ketinggian air di atas dua meter. Siang harinya, genangan meluas ke akses vital seperti Underpass Dewa Ruci yang lumpuh total. Dampak signifikan juga terjadi di Jalan Hasanuddin, di mana ruko roboh dan menelan korban jiwa. Pada sore hingga malam, sebagian wilayah mulai surut, meski masih menyisakan titik genangan persisten seperti di kawasan Nakula dan Dewi Sri.",
        paragraph6: "Dampak yang tercatat melalui data warga cukup besar. Setidaknya 18 korban meninggal, lebih dari 200 jiwa mengungsi, dan sejumlah infrastruktur vital lumpuh. Pasar tradisional sebagai pusat ekonomi, layanan kesehatan seperti RSUD Mangusada, serta jalur transportasi utama menuju Kuta–Sanur terganggu. Selain itu, kerusakan struktural berupa rumah roboh, erosi tebing sungai, dan akumulasi sampah di aliran Tukad Badung memperparah situasi pasca banjir.",
        paragraph7: "Temuan ini menegaskan bahwa metode crowdsourcing berbasis media sosial mampu memberikan gambaran cepat, detail, dan spasial mengenai bencana perkotaan. Meski memiliki keterbatasan dalam hal pengukuran kuantitatif, data partisipatif dari masyarakat memperkaya informasi resmi dengan memperlihatkan titik genangan aktual, kronologi kejadian, serta narasi pengalaman langsung warga. Dengan demikian, crowdsourcing dapat menjadi pelengkap penting bagi sistem pemantauan dan dokumentasi bencana di masa depan, sekaligus menegaskan perlunya peningkatan peringatan dini dan kesiapsiagaan berbasis komunitas di Bali."

Tragedi ini bukan sekadar data untuk bahan evaluasi program MCR 2030; ini adalah bukti nyata bahwa program-program tersebut belum berhasil menyentuh akar masalah kerentanan, tata ruang, dan daya dukung lingkungan yang terlanjur rusak.",
        gapConclusion: "Peran Bali sebagai panggung global kini dibayangi oleh ironi. Pulau ini telah sukses menjadi tuan rumah bagi dunia untuk membahas cara menyelamatkan planet, namun masih berjuang untuk menyelamatkan dirinya sendiri."

      conclusion: {
        title: "Rakyat diminta percaya pada sistem.\nLalu sistem menyalahkan cuaca.",
        content1: "Banjir Denpasar pada September 2025 menjadi pengingat yang menyakitkan: kepercayaan publik adalah aset rapuh yang mudah terkikis oleh pembenaran yang ringkas. Ketika air surut, hal pertama yang disodorkan kepada rakyat adalah narasi tunggal—bahwa bencana ini adalah gara-gara cuaca ekstrem. Sistem dengan sigap menggunakan data ilmiah tentang Gelombang Rossby atau MJO untuk membersihkan tangan dari tanggung jawab struktural.",
        content2: "Padahal, banjir ini adalah hasil dari kalkulasi yang rumit antara curah hujan yang di luar kendali dan kegagalan sistem yang berada di bawah kendali. Kegagalan ini terwujud dalam: izin-izin pembangunan yang terus dikeluarkan di daerah resapan air, sistem drainase kota yang didiamkan tersumbat oleh sampah bertahun-tahun, dan inkonsistensi tata ruang yang mengorbankan sungai demi kepentingan properti. Sistem telah gagal mengurus hal-hal mendasar, namun meminta rakyat untuk menerima alasan yang paling mudah: bahwa alam sedang murka.",
        content3: "Banjir Denpasar 2025 menjadi pengingat keras bahwa ketangguhan bukan lahir dari rapat-rapat megah atau dokumen tebal, tapi dari aksi nyata yang terasa di kehidupan sehari-hari. Ketangguhan tidak akan tercapai jika pemerintah hanya menjadi administrator yang melimpahkan kesalahan kepada fenomena alam.",
        content4: "Sudah saatnya Bali tidak hanya menjadi panggung diskusi global, tetapi juga sebagai tanah yang benar-benar tangguh, di mana semangat resiliensi tumbuh dan menguat hingga ke kebijakan tertinggi. Bali tidak perlu lagi menjadi etalase seminar iklim yang diakhiri dengan kebijakan lokal yang rapuh. Resiliensi sejati adalah akuntabilitas.",
        reflection: "Resiliensi tumbuh dari akar, dari masyarakat yang saling menjaga, dari tradisi yang menghormati alam, hingga ke kebijakan yang berpihak pada kehidupan. Dan, di tengah lumpur dan air yang surut perlahan, kita perlu berhenti sejenak untuk bertanya: sudahkah kita benar-benar belajar dari bencana, atau hanya sebagai penonton menunggu bencana berikutnya datang? Pertanyaan itu bukan untuk rakyat yang membersihkan rumah mereka, melainkan untuk sistem yang bertugas menjaga janji perlindungan."
