# Banjir Denpasar Scrollytelling Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for creating a Washington Post-style scrollytelling visualization of the September 10, 2025 Denpasar flood disaster.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite
- **Scrollytelling**: Scrollama.js
- **Mapping**: Mapbox GL JS with React bindings
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js and Recharts
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Typography plugin
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons

### Data Structure
- **flood_points.geojson**: 57 documented flood points with severity classifications
- **flood_impact.geojson**: Flood impact polygons with depth classifications
- **rivers.geojson**: River network data
- **admin_boundaries.geojson**: Administrative boundaries for Denpasar and Badung
- **watersheds.geojson**: Watershed boundaries
- **river_buffers.geojson**: River buffer zones

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure (Week 1)
- [x] Project setup with Vite, React, and Tailwind
- [x] Basic scrollama integration
- [x] Core component structure (ScrollStep, StickyContainer)
- [x] Data folder with processed GeoJSON files
- [x] Basic App.jsx with hero section and placeholder content

### Phase 2: Map Integration (Week 2)
- [x] Mapbox GL JS integration
- [x] Display flood points on interactive map
- [x] Implement severity-based styling
- [x] Add base map layers (satellite, streets)
- [x] Implement map interactions (zoom, pan)

### Phase 3: Scrollytelling Logic (Week 3)
- [x] Connect scroll steps to map updates
- [x] Implement timeline-based flood progression
- [x] Add location-based content for each scroll step
- [x] Create smooth transitions between map states

### Phase 4: Multimedia Integration (Week 4)
- [x] Integrate citizen videos and social media content
- [x] Create Instagram and TikTok embed components
- [x] Implement fallback components for embed failures
- [x] Add video thumbnails and captions

### Phase 5: Data Visualization (Week 5)
- [x] Implement charts for flood statistics
- [x] Create severity distribution visualizations
- [x] Add meteorological data visualizations
- [x] Implement economic impact charts

### Phase 6: Content Development (Week 6)
- [ ] Write narrative content for each section
- [ ] Add survivor testimonies and quotes
- [ ] Create educational content about flood preparedness
- [ ] Develop memorial section for victims

### Phase 7: Polish and Optimization (Week 7)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

### Phase 8: Deployment (Week 8)
- [ ] Final testing
- [ ] Deployment to hosting platform
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Key Features to Implement

### Interactive Map
- [x] Display 57 flood points with severity coding

- [x] Add location information on click

### Scrollytelling Narrative
- [x] Three-act structure (Buildup, Crisis, Aftermath)
- [x] Scroll-triggered map updates
- [x] Synchronized multimedia content
- [x] Data-driven storytelling

### Multimedia Integration
- [x] Citizen video embeds with fallbacks
- [x] Social media integration (Instagram, TikTok)
- [x] Before/after imagery comparison
- [x] News coverage timeline

### Data Visualizations
- [x] Flood severity distribution
- [x] Timeline of events
- [x] Economic impact charts
- [x] Meteorological data visualizations
- [x] Infrastructure vulnerability maps

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Variables
